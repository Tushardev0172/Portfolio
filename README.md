# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and past work as a Frontend and MERN stack developer.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of my portfolio website here: [My Portfolio](https://tushar-portfolio-site.netlify.app/)

## Overview

This portfolio website is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my professional experience, projects, and technical expertise. It's a place where potential employers, clients, and collaborators can learn more about me, my work, and how to get in touch.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The website's frontend is built with React.js, which allows for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and design, I used Tailwind CSS. This utility-first CSS framework enabled me to quickly build a responsive and modern UI with minimal custom CSS.

- **React Scroll**: Smooth scrolling effects throughout the website are powered by React Scroll, enhancing the user experience by providing seamless navigation between different sections.

- **Getform.io**: The contact form on the website is integrated with Getform.io to handle form submissions. This service allows me to easily collect and manage contact information from visitors.

- **React Icons**: Icons used throughout the site are sourced from React Icons, providing a wide range of high-quality icons to enhance the visual appeal of the website.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and looks great on all device sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
  
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Navigation between different sections of the site is smooth and fluid, thanks to React Scroll.

- **Contact Form**: Visitors can easily reach out to me via the contact form, which is simple and efficient, powered by Getform.io.

- **Iconography**: Consistent and visually appealing icons are used throughout the site, enhancing the overall user experience.
